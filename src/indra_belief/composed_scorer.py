"""Composed belief scorer: parametric noise model + LLM hard gate.

Bridges LLM verdict output with the parametric noise model. The LLM
acts as a binary filter: each evidence sentence is either included
(counts in the noise model) or excluded (removed). Sources with all
evidence excluded are dropped entirely.

Two entry points:

  Per-evidence:
    scorer = ComposedBeliefScorer(priors=RECALIBRATED_PRIORS)
    result = scorer.score_edge(evidence_with_verdicts)

  Statement-native:
    score = score_statement_belief(statement, client)
    # internally: score_statement → list[dict] per Evidence,
    #             folded into EvidenceRecords → score_edge

The statement-native form addresses a truth-vs-scoring granularity
mismatch: INDRA tags reflect aggregate-across-N-evidences truth, but
score_evidence runs per-sentence. score_statement_belief aggregates
per-sentence verdicts into one statement-level belief, matching the
truth granularity.

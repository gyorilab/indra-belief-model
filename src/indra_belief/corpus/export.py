"""Belief export — Phase 6 of the rasmachine task graph.

Closes the loop: takes a `score_run`, aggregates per-evidence scores into
a per-statement belief, and emits an INDRA-native JSON dump where each
Statement's `belief` field is replaced with our score. The collaborator
can rebuild the EMMAA / rasmachine model from this and measure
downstream lift.

Aggregation rule (default, **mean of per-evidence scores**) is the no-gold
default and matches the validity layer's calibration computation. Phase
6.1's open-question framing kept the rule swappable: pass `aggregator=`
to override (noisy-OR, epistemics-weighted, supports-graph-aware are all
research questions to be settled by Phase 4 + 6 calibration on rasmachine
once we run the real corpus).

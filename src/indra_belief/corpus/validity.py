"""Validity-layer metric computation — Phase 4 of the rasmachine task graph.

Branches on truth presence at runtime (D7):

  - **4a (truth-present)**: per-step precision/recall/F1, confusion matrices,
    score-level calibration vs gold. Requires `truth_label` rows for the
    relevant scorer_step / stmt / evidence target_kinds.
    Evidence-level benchmark `tag` labels are interpreted only as a binary
    correctness target for these P/R/F1 metrics: `correct` is positive, every
    other tag is not-correct. Fine-grained tag taxonomy analysis is separate
    future work.

  - **4b (no-truth)**: INDRA-belief calibration, inter-evidence consistency,
    gold-overlap subset, supports-graph plausibility. Always available so
    long as the corpus carries `indra_published_belief` truth labels (the
    loader auto-registers these on every ingest).

Metrics are written to the `metric` table keyed by (run_id, optional
truth_set_id, metric_name, slice_json). G4 honest-failure: any metric
that *cannot* be computed from the loaded slice writes a row with
`value=NaN` and a `slice_json.unavailable_reason` field rather than
silently substituting zero.

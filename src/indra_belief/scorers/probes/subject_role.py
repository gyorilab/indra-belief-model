"""subject_role probe — what role does the claim's subject play in evidence?

Closed answer set: present_as_subject, present_as_object, present_as_mediator,
present_as_decoy, absent.

Substrate fast-path (router) handles the high-confidence cases:
  - CATALOG match with subject as agent → present_as_subject
  - subject's aliases not in evidence → absent
  - chain signal + subject in chain candidates → present_as_mediator

This module handles the LLM escalation: when substrate has a hint but
not an answer (entity present, role ambiguous, or substrate flagged
role-swap candidate), the LLM classifies into the closed set.

Few-shot curriculum:
  1. role-clear subject ("MAPK1 phosphorylates JUN" → present_as_subject)
  2. role-swap (claim subject is named as the TARGET of the relation)
  3. mediator (claim subject named in a chain but not at either end)
  4. decoy (claim subject mentioned but in a non-claim relation)
  5. absent (claim subject not mentioned despite hint claiming it is —
     forces LLM to override over-confident substrate hints)

Each shot exemplifies ONE answer; together they cover the closed set.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You classify the role of a single biomedical entity (the CLAIM SUBJECT) \
in an evidence sentence.

Answer ONE of:
  present_as_subject — the entity acts as the SUBJECT/AGENT of the \
    sentence's main relation (it does the action).
  present_as_object  — the entity is named as the TARGET/OBJECT of the \
    main relation (the action is done TO it). This catches role-swap.
  present_as_mediator — the entity sits in the middle of a chain \
    (X → ENTITY → Y), neither the upstream initiator nor the final \
    target; sentence frames it as an intermediate.
  present_as_decoy   — the entity is mentioned but in a relation other \
    than the claim's (e.g., as a control, co-treatment, bystander, or \
    in an adjacent claim that doesn't bear on the claim relation).
  absent             — the entity is not mentioned in the evidence.

Output ONE JSON object: {"answer": <one_of_above>, "rationale": <short_phrase>}.
Be terse. The "rationale" is a 5-15 word phrase quoting the relevant \
words from the evidence. NO prose outside the JSON."""

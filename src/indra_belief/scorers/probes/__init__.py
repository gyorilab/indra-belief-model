"""Probe pipeline.

Replaces the monolithic parse_evidence with four narrow probes
(subject_role, object_role, relation_axis, scope) routed through a
substrate-first orchestrator. Each probe commits a single decision from
a closed answer set; the adjudicator combines them via a flat decision
table.

See research/archive/completed_phases/s_phase_doctrine.md for full design rationale.

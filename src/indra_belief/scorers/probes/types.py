"""Typed probe-request and probe-response shapes for the probe pipeline.

Each probe is one question with a closed answer set. The architectural
commitment is single-decision-per-call: the parser commits ONE value
from ONE small enum, not a multi-slot extraction.
for the four probe definitions and the adjudicator decision table.

Substrate is a question-router. Where it can answer deterministically
(M9 entity-first LOF, exact CATALOG match, explicit hedge marker in
scope), it returns ProbeResponse with source="substrate". Where it has
at most a hint, it returns a ProbeRequest with substrate_hint set; the
LLM answers but the hint never prefills the answer.

Validation is load-bearing: probe-kind ↔ answer-set pairing is
enforced at construction time. A relation_axis response carrying a
scope-axis answer raises ValueError, not a silent miscategorization.

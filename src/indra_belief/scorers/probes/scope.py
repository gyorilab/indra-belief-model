"""scope probe — is the relation between subject and object asserted,
hedged, or negated in the evidence?

Closed answer set: asserted, hedged, negated, abstain.

Substrate fast-path covers explicit M10 hedge markers and verb-negator
proximity hits between subject and object positions. The LLM handles
softer cases — "may have", "putative", "appears to", "we tested",
"it remains unclear", and rhetorical-not constructions.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You classify the EPISTEMIC SCOPE of the relation between two named \
entities in an evidence sentence.

The CLAIM names a relation between subject and object. Your job is to \
classify how the sentence FRAMES that relation — independent of \
whether it's true.

Answer ONE of:
  asserted — the sentence directly affirms the relation. Includes \
    declarative ("X activates Y"), passive ("Y is activated by X"), \
    and presupposed framings ("the X-Y interaction is required for...").
  hedged   — the sentence proposes the relation as exploratory, \
    hypothetical, or putative. Includes "may", "might", "could", \
    "we hypothesize", "appears to", "putative", "is thought to", \
    "we tested whether", "it remains unclear if".
  negated  — the sentence explicitly denies the relation. Includes \
    "X did not activate Y", "Y was not phosphorylated by X", \
    "no effect of X on Y was observed".
  abstain  — the sentence does not commit to any of the above for \
    THIS relation (relation not directly described, or the framing \
    is genuinely ambiguous).

CRITICAL: focus on the CLAIM RELATION specifically. Hedging or \
negation that governs a DIFFERENT proposition in the same sentence \
does NOT propagate. "X activates Y, but Z was not affected" → asserted \
for X→Y; the negation governs Z.

Output ONE JSON object: {"answer": <one_of_above>, "rationale": <short_phrase>}.
The "rationale" is a 5-15 word phrase quoting the relevant words from \
the evidence. NO prose outside the JSON."""

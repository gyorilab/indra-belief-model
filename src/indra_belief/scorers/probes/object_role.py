You classify the role of a single biomedical entity (the CLAIM OBJECT) \
in an evidence sentence.

Answer ONE of:
  present_as_object  — the entity is the TARGET/OBJECT of the main \
    relation (the action is done TO it). The expected role for a \
    well-aligned claim object.
  present_as_subject — the entity acts as the SUBJECT/AGENT of the main \
    relation (it does the action). This catches role-swap.
  present_as_mediator — the entity sits in the middle of a chain \
    (X → ENTITY → Y), neither the upstream initiator nor the final \
    target.
  present_as_decoy   — the entity is mentioned but in a relation other \
    than the claim's (control, co-treatment, bystander, adjacent claim).
  absent             — the entity is not mentioned in the evidence.

Output ONE JSON object: {"answer": <one_of_above>, "rationale": <short_phrase>}.
The "rationale" is a 5-15 word phrase quoting the relevant words from \
the evidence. NO prose outside the JSON."""

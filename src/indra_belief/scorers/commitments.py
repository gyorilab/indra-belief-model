"""Typed intermediate commitments for the S-phase scorer.

Each sub-call produces or consumes one of these:
  parse_claim       → ClaimCommitment
  grounding_verify  → GroundingVerdict (per claim entity)
  adjudicate        → Adjudication

The S-phase deleted EvidenceCommitment / EvidenceAssertion (per doctrine
§7 migration discipline) — the parser no longer extracts a multi-slot
schema; the four probes (subject_role, object_role, relation_axis,
scope) commit single-decision answers in their closed sets, and the
adjudicator combines those via a flat decision table.

`rationale` fields on GroundingVerdict and Adjudication remain
INFORMATIONAL ONLY. No decision logic may read them. Reason codes
encode every gating-relevant fact.

# Gilda's FPLX rosters are sparse for some families: GPCR collapses to
# only ~25 members despite ~800 documented receptors; 14-3-3 / TCF_LEF
# / IKB return only the canonical name with no member roster. The L8
# diagnosis traced 13+ FNs to these under-expanded families.
#
# This backfill is a curated static patch — each entry includes the
# canonical name and a roster of accepted member surface forms. Entries
# are merged into the entity's alias set after Gilda resolution; both
# the parser-bind path and the M3 substrate-fallback see the expanded
# aliases.
#
# Validation discipline: every entry must be auditable against the
# FPLX yaml (https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex). When updating,
# verify against the upstream roster — over-expansion causes precision
# loss in the bilateral_ambiguity guard (L3) which already handles
# family-family confidence downgrades, so the cost is bounded but real.
#

#   1. Multi-sentence Evidence.text — split on sentence boundaries
#      ('. ' or '? ' or '! '). Per-sentence parse is cheaper than
#      multi-sentence reasoning at single-shot.
#   2. Long-single-sentence with multiple subordinators — left to the
#      single-shot path. We do NOT regex-split on subordinators here;

#      M3 substrate-fallback bind now handle the residual class.

"""Monolithic single-call belief scorer — sibling to the decomposed
four-probe pipeline.

Two-tier architecture (single LLM call per (Statement, Evidence)):
  Tier 1: Deterministic grounding check (GroundedEntity.should_auto_reject)
    - MISMATCH → auto-reject
    - PSEUDOGENE + AMBIGUOUS → auto-reject
    - AMBIGUOUS → LLM judges with grounding context
  Tier 2: LLM text comprehension
    - base system prompt + adaptive contrastive examples (14 per record,
      retrieved by statement type via _TYPE_BANK + _TYPE_ADJACENCY)
    - Entity context injected from ScoringRecord
    - Output: single JSON verdict extracted via extract_verdict()

The decomposed sibling lives in indra_belief.scorers.probes.*.
Selection between architectures is via the CLI `--arch` flag in
indra_belief.scorers.scorer. This module is invoked through
`score_evidence(stmt, ev, client)` and `score_statement(stmt, client)`
defined at the bottom — same public signatures as the decomposed path.

Run:
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m indra_belief.scorers.scorer --arch monolithic ...

How to read it:
- If the top candidate is a gene family (FPLX) and the evidence mentions
  a specific member, that is still a valid claim per rule 2.
- If the top candidate is a chemical, lipid (CHEBI), or MeSH concept, the
  "gene" in the claim may be a conflation with a non-protein entity. If
  the evidence describes actions on that non-gene entity (e.g. a lipid
  receptor extracting as the lipid itself), treat it as a grounding error.
- If the top candidate is a pseudogene, the claim is likely wrong unless
  the evidence explicitly describes pseudogene transcripts.
- If "query is a known alias" is False, and the top candidate is a
  different gene from the claim, this is a grounding error.
